## Once upon a time, there were twins - a brother and sister, named Jack and Bailey.  They had much in common, that's for sure, such as their black, black hair, and their love for Nellie, their dog.  But there's one thing Jack and Bailey cannot live without. (Not Nellie, but nice try.) 

#### It was their portable trampoline! Those two brought it everywhere.  Literally, EVERYWHERE.  The airport, the grocery store, the doctor's office, everywhere.  Including, unfortunately, school. 

##### Almost every day, a note came home saying: "Jack and Bailey jumping during class... AGAIN. Please make them keep the trampoline home. Signed, Mrs. Jennafer."  But they didn't listen.  They kept on bringing the thing.  Until...
